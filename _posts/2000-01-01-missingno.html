<h2 id="Who-is-this-pokemon-?">Who is this pokemon ?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Who-is-this-pokemon-?">Â¶</a></h2><p>In the pokemon serie, there was a strange monster that appeared to some of the players, MissingNo.
It could not be encountered in the wild, but rather after a bug like the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Old_man_glitch">old man glitch</a>.
This pokemon resulted from a wrong pokÃ©dex entry during a fight, he is actually not unique and has <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/MissingNo.">a lot of variations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="MissingNo.-in-PokÃ©Clicker">MissingNo. in PokÃ©Clicker<a class="anchor-link" href="#MissingNo.-in-PokÃ©Clicker">Â¶</a></h2><p>This pokÃ©mon was added to PokÃ©Clicker mostly as an easter egg and cannot be obtainable through normal manner.
He is used for error handling (if there is a bug within the game), and his pokÃ©dex entry is #0.
Hopefully, we can easilly access the game's data to found a way to obtain it.</p>
<h2 id="Obtaining-the-pokmon-using-the-javascript-console">Obtaining the pokmon using the javascript console<a class="anchor-link" href="#Obtaining-the-pokmon-using-the-javascript-console">Â¶</a></h2><p>PokÃ©clicker is an open-source, community driven game that is mostly developped using Javascript.
The source code is <a href="https://github.com/pokeclicker/pokeclicker">available on github</a> if you are curious.</p>
<p>Most of the important functions are public, hence is it really easy to access the in-game memory using any web browser.
Indeed, nowadays most if not all browser acts as an IDE and hence have access to a debug environement. Thanks to that, anyone can modify the data completely offline!
For the rest, I will provide the instructions for firefox only, but it should be easilly transferrable to chrome, or edge.</p>
<ol>
<li>First make a save of your game, just in case.</li>
<li>Then simply press <code>F12</code> to access the web console, or click on the settings icon (up right) then <code>More tools/Web Developer Tools</code>.</li>
<li>You can now use the public function to gain a pokemon, using <code>id=0</code> as a parameter:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>App.game.party.gainPokemonById<span class="o">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Congratulations, you just obtained MissingNo. !</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<p>I should not tell you that, but you can of course change the id to another pokÃ©mon...</p>
<p>There is also another optionnal parameter. If you want it to be shiny, put the parameter to <code>1</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>App.game.party.gainPokemonById<span class="o">(</span><span class="m">0</span>, <span class="m">1</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Obviously this is not the only function that you can have access to!
If you want to cheat, after typing <code>App.game</code> you will see the list of available class/functions.
Check for example <code>App.game.wallet.gainMoney</code> ðŸ’° ðŸ˜ˆ ðŸ’°</p>
<p>Use it sporadically (or not at all) if you don't want to ruin your gameplay.</p>
