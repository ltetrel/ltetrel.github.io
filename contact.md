I am Loïc Tetrel, a young **data science** engineer 👨‍🔬 (M. A. Sc.) with a focus in the **medical** field . 
Coming from **France** 🇫🇷, I also speak **polish** 🇵🇱, **english** 🇺🇸 and currently learning **arabic** 🇲🇦 (*tough language, why I am doing that...!*).

I spent a total of 6 years for my study beginning with a technical degree in **industrial engineering** at the [IUT Lyon 1](https://iut.univ-lyon1.fr/formation/offre-de-formations/gim/dut-genie-industriel-et-maintenance-602581.kjsp?RH=1432134288557). Then, I followed a double degree at the [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/) in **electrical engineering** and my **research** at [ETS](https://www.etsmtl.ca/) on **sensorless 3D ultrasound**.

From there, I acquired experience in the **digital dentistry** field as a software developper for [Straumann Group](https://www.straumann.com/group/en/home.html), where I worked on 3D scanning as part of the R&D team.
Now, I am a full-time data science engineer at the [simexp lab](https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/), working on **deep learning** for neuro-imaging and **open-source** projects.

Really curious about technology in general, video games 🤖 and reading 📖 (fantasy, SF, politics). I also do sport, play guitar in my spare time and love traveling all around the world 🌍.
