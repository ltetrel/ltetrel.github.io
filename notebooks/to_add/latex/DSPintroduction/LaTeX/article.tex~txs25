	\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
	Thomas Bayes is a well known mathematician, with work focused in probability. Bayes theory\cite{bayes1958essay} is central in machine learning and has numerous applications in automatic classification.
	
	\section{Theory}\label{theory}
	Consider two event $a$ and $b$, the Bayesian rule define the probability $P$ that $a$ occurs, knowing the result of the event $b$ :
	
	\begin{equation}
	P(a|b) = \frac{P(b|a) \times P(a)}{P(b)} 
	\end{equation}
	
	It can be interpreted as is : if we know a priori the probabilities of the events $a$, $b$, and the result of the event $b$ (knowing result of $a$), then we can deduct the result $a$ (knowing result of $b$). \\ Using this rule will allow us to infer things about the income of events, when you have some aprioris. This is the base in Machine Learning, with training data, you infer the result for testing data.
		
	\section{Code example}\label{example}
	
	In Machine learning, we usually refer the probability as a function.
