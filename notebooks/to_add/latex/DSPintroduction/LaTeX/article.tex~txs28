	\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
	All modern computers used the so-called Von Newmann architecture. John von Neumann was a child prodigy working on the game theory \cite{von2007theory}, created the first computers, and also developped the Monte Carlo method.
	\par
	The brain of this computer is called the CPU (Central Processing Unit) which will perform operations using an ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit) and control operations (Control Unit) coming from the instructions. It communicates to its memory units where for example the list of instructions are stored, and to other input/output devices (extrernal memory, GPU ...) using a bus \footnote{From the latin omnibus, declination of omnia which means "to many".}.

	explanation of the different devices in a computer
	
	Assembly language is the lowest level programming language, where the instructions are directly correlated on the architecture of the device.
	When you compile a program, the compiler will create .asm objects. Theses are set of instruction coded in assembly language, which will later be transformed into binary objects (this is what your CPU understand).
