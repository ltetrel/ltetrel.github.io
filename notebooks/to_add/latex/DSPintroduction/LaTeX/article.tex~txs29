	\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
	All modern computers used the so-called Von Newmann architecture. John von Neumann was a child prodigy working on the game theory \cite{von2007theory}, created the first computers, and also developped the Monte Carlo method.
	\par
	The brain of this computer is called the CPU (Central Processing Unit) which will perform operations using an ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit) and control operations (Control Unit) coming from the instructions. It communicates to its memory units where for example the list of instructions are stored, and to other input/output devices (extrernal memory, GPU ...) using a bus \footnote{From the latin omnibus which means "to many", plural datif declination of omnia.}. Other architectures derived from the Von Newmann like the Havard architecture, which separate the program and data memory. So the ALU can access in the same time (using two different buses) the data and the instructions.

	\end{figure}
	
	To perform actions, the CPU needs to read from its memory a set of instructions which can be performed under the supervision of the control unit. This set of instructions are called a program, and is written in assembly. First let's focus on 
	

	
	\section{Hardware architecture}\label{theory}
	
	\section{Assembly language}
	
		Assembly language is the lowest level programming language, where the instructions are directly correlated on the architecture of the device.
	When you compile a program, the compiler will create .asm objects. Theses are set of instruction coded in assembly language, which will later be transformed into binary objects (this is what your CPU understand).
