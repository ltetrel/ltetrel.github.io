	\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
	In a machine learning, it is really important to choose wisely the features, which will abstract the meaning of the image. In an image containing thousands of thousands pixels, you can use features like SIFT \cite{lowe1999object}, Harris corner detection \cite{harris1988combined}, parameters from a model where your pixels come from... The process of comparing a feature with another one is called \textbf{selection}. Another way to extract good feature is \textbf{projection} and this is the purpose of this article.
	\par The key idea is to abstract all your data in a new dimension space
