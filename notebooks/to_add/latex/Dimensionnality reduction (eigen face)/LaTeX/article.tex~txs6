	\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
	\par Daniel G. Kringe was the first to define a Gaussian Process in a new interpolation method to evaluate mining ressources in geostatistics. In this time, we were talking about Kriging \cite{krige1951statistical}. Later, Rasmussen\cite{rasmussen2006gaussian} propose to develop the Gaussian Process theory to do machine learning.
	\url{http://katbailey.github.io/post/gaussian-processes-for-dummies/}
	\par The function $f$ is a Gaussian Process ($\mathcal{GP}$) if every outputs from a function $\{y(x_0),...,y(x_N)\}$ has a multivariate gaussian distribution :
	
	\begin{equation}
	f(x_1,x_2, ...) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma),
	\end{equation}
	où
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\mu} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\mu_1\\
	\mu_2\\
	\vdots \\
	\end{bmatrix};
	\qquad 
	\Sigma = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\Sigma(m_1,m_1) & \Sigma(m_1,m_2) & \dots \\
	\Sigma(m_2,m_1) & \Sigma(m_2,m_2) & \dots \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
	\end{bmatrix}.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	This paper shows that measurement error can effectively be learned from tracked data and used towards improved sensorless freehand 3D US reconstruction.  
	%the importance of measurement selection in sensorless freehand 3D US. We introduced a new 
	Our error weighted graph-based method %based on a graph generating an accurate reconstruction 
	%taking into account measurement quality 
	%that 
	significantly improves over the state-of-the-art. 
	%On average, we achieve a mTRE lower than $5$ mm over sequences longer than $20$ mm. 
	Future work will concentrate on adapting our method to %the case of 
	non-Rayleigh scattering conditions. %and quantitative results of volumetric reconstruction.
	%We prove that the accumulation of error has to be controlled (see the results of NN and CSq) and that choosing more wisely the motions affects the result ($p=0.004$). 
	%Our contribution start to be significant from the last $35$ frames of each acquisition which correspond to long acquisition at least $\sim25$ mm width. In average on all the acquisition, the mTRE is lower than $5$ mm which is really encouraging for sensorless 3D reconstruction knowing our real freehand motion (lot of rotations and translations).
	%Future work will concentrate in the problematic of real tissue where we think will lead to better results (because it is easier to qualify a good registration in this context).
	%The averaging algorithm can be extended to any work leading in the search of shortest path in a graph and improve the result for wide graph.
